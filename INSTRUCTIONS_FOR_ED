As I'm not entierly sure of how bitbake works, I will just give you a few pointers to how it should be installed.

First of all, the makefile in the root directory should respect cross compiling, so that shouldn't be a problem.
It also compiles the plugins.

The binary "configbutton" that's present in the root directory can be installed anywhere, but the normal directory /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin is probably most suitable. Running the binary will make it pop up in the tray, so it should be started from the session file.

The contents of plugin/bin are the actual plugins, these should either go into /usr/share/configbutton or $(HOME)/.configbutton/. Plugins are loaded from both locations.

If you take the time to find suitable icons, give me the absolute path to them. Icons can be stored anywhere on the filesystem, I just needs to know where they are.
